# **App Name**: IdeaMesh

## Core Features:

- Node Creation: Create and edit idea nodes with titles and content, allowing users to capture their thoughts effectively.
- Edge Creation: Connect nodes with customizable semantic relationships such as 'supports', 'contradicts', etc., enabling users to map the connections between ideas.
- Graph Visualization: Visualize the graph structure with an interactive, force-directed layout, providing a clear overview of the knowledge network.
- Theme and Tag Support: Group nodes using themes and tags, and filter the graph based on these, allowing users to organize and focus on specific areas of interest.
- Quick Search: Search across the graph to quickly locate specific nodes and relationships, ensuring efficient information retrieval.
- Data Export: Export graph data in Markdown or JSON format for backup and portability, ensuring data is safe and available across platforms.
- AI Link Suggestions: Suggest potential links and relationships between nodes, acting as a tool for idea discovery and helping users uncover hidden connections. The LLM uses reasoning to decide when to suggest connections.
- Graph Privacy Settings: Enable users to create public and private graphs, controlling the visibility and accessibility of their knowledge networks.
- AI Graph Summarization: Implement an AI-driven summarization tool that condenses complex graphs into concise summaries, making it easier to grasp the core ideas and insights. The LLM uses reasoning to decide what to include in the summary.
- Drag-and-Drop Reordering: Support drag-and-drop functionality for reordering nodes and edges, allowing users to customize the layout and organization of their graphs.
- Focus Mode: Implement a focus mode that dims the non-selected nodes and edges to allow the user to focus on a specific train of thought.
- Node Customization: Enable users to customize node shapes and colors for visual differentiation.
- Smart Search: Integrate a 'smart' search that understands the context of the graph and suggests related nodes even if the search term doesn't directly match.
- Multimedia Embeddings: Allow users to embed multimedia content (images, videos, audio) within nodes to enrich their ideas.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted purple (#A08ABF) to evoke creativity and thoughtfulness.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F2) for a clean and distraction-free workspace.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#B4A8D3) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and neutral appearance.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different relationship types and node functions, ensuring a clean and intuitive user experience.
- Ensure a modern, simplistic, and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, with a focus on clarity and ease of use.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user engagement without being distracting, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- Incorporate a clean, minimal sidebar for settings and controls, ensuring it doesn't distract from the graph itself.
- Use a slightly larger font size for improved readability, especially on larger screens.
- Consider using a set of open-source icons (e.g., Font Awesome, Material Icons) for consistency and scalability.
